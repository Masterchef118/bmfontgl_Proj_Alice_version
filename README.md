# bmfontgl_Proj_Alice_version
Modification of bmfontgl to prepare it for integration into Project Alice. See Project Alice here: https://github.com/schombert/Project-Alice

This program can read bitmap font files (.fnt and .tga only), generate a font from them, and render given text in that font.
The program looks in a certain directory given in the code for the files it needs. The file names the program looks for
are also given in the code. This directory must be a real location and must contain the named .fnt and .tga files for the 
program to not crash.

There are NO user-provided requirements.

This project has been forked and modified from the original at: https://github.com/dharani811/bmfontgl
